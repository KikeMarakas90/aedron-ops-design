# Design Patterns

Reusable operational and analytical patterns engineered for stability, productivity, visibility, governance and decision intelligence.

This section introduces enterprise-grade patterns such as:

- **Operational Stability Pattern (CV, CVM, IQR)** — statistical foundation to govern volatility, outliers and execution predictability.
- **Productivity Normalization Pattern** — harmonizing workload, throughput and performance across heterogeneous teams and geographies.
- **Semantic KPI Pattern** — standardized structure for multi-domain metrics with governance, lineage, semantic definitions and ownership.
- **AI-Assisted Workflow Pattern** — human + machine pattern using LLM/RAG assistants embedded into operational flows.

Each pattern is designed to be:
- **Modular** — reusable across industries and business units.
- **Governed** — aligned to semantic controls and decision rights.
- **AI-Enabled** — extensible to autonomous/augmented scenarios.
- **Cross-domain** — applicable to CPG, Pharma, Insurance and R&D.
- **Execution-ready** — built for real-world operational adoption.

(Patterns coming soon.)
