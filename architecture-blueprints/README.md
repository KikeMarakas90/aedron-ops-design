# Architecture Blueprints

Strategic enterprise architectures engineered for next-generation operations across CPG, Insurance, Manufacturing, Pharma, and R&D ecosystems.

These blueprints are **not data stack diagrams**.  
They are **decision operating architectures** — modular, governed, and AI-enabled systems designed to control complexity, volatility, and execution at enterprise scale.

Each blueprint reframes operations as an **operating system**, where intelligence, governance, and execution are architected together.

## Blueprints Library

### **CPG Global Ops Operating System (v1)**
A modular operating architecture for multi-country manufacturing and supply operations.

Designed around:
- an **Intelligence Fabric** for end-to-end signal integration  
- **Cloud + Edge hybrid execution** for stability and responsiveness  
- a **governed KPI Engine** as the enterprise nervous system  

→ `cpg-global-ops-operating-system.md`

### **Insurance Operational Intelligence Stack (v1)**
A decision-ready architecture for claims, provider payments, and operational governance.

Focused on:
- semantic control and KPI integrity  
- stability-first performance management  
- closed-loop decision execution across operations  

→ `insurance-operational-intelligence-stack.md`

## Design Principles (Aedron Standard)

Every blueprint in this library is engineered according to five non-negotiable principles:

- **Modular** — composable capabilities with clear ownership boundaries  
- **Governed** — semantic control, KPI integrity, and accountability by design  
- **AI-Enabled** — decision intelligence embedded in execution pathways (RAG / LLM-inspired)  
- **Interoperable** — API-first integration across domains and platforms  
- **Future-Proof** — resilient to complexity, scale, regulation, and technology shifts  

These principles ensure each architecture remains coherent, scalable, and decision-ready over time.

## Roadmap

Upcoming blueprints:

- **Digital R&D Architecture Mesh (v1)**  
  Federated, AI-enabled decision architecture for multi-lab, multi-portfolio R&D environments.
