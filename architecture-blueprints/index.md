# Architecture Blueprints

Strategic enterprise architectures designed for next-generation operations across CPG, Pharma, Insurance, Manufacturing and R&D ecosystems.

This section hosts high-level conceptual blueprints such as:

- **Digital R&D Architecture Mesh (v1)** — a federated, AI-enabled architecture for multi-lab, multi-portfolio R&D.
- [CPG Global Ops Operating System (v1)](cpg-global-ops-operating-system.html) — modular operating architecture for multi-country manufacturing and supply operations.
- [Insurance Operational Intelligence Stack (v1)](insurance-operational-intelligence-stack.html) — decision-ready architecture for claims, provider payments and operational governance.

Each blueprint is engineered around five core principles:
- **Modular** — composable capabilities with clear ownership boundaries.
- **Governed** — semantic control, KPI integrity and accountability by design.
- **AI-Enabled** — RAG/LLM-augmented decision intelligence at every layer.
- **Interoperable** — cross-domain, API-first value realization.
- **Future-Proof** — resilient to complexity, scale and technology shifts.
