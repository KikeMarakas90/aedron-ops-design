# Conceptual Frameworks

Core strategic frameworks that define how modern, complex enterprises design clarity, interoperability and decision intelligence at scale.

This section consolidates the foundational models behind next-gen operating architectures, including:

- **Semantic Layer Governance Model (v1)** — enterprise-wide blueprint for metric integrity, lineage, ownership and decision accountability.
- **Operational Intelligence Reference Model (v1)** — integrating productivity, stability, talent analytics and execution readiness.
- **AI-Augmented Decision Fabric (v1)** — conceptual pattern for embedding LLM/RAG capabilities into business-critical processes.
- **Value Steering Framework (v1)** — cross-domain governance and financial alignment for analytics, AI and digital investments.

These frameworks enable organizations to:
- Establish **semantic consistency** across domains.
- Govern **KPIs, metrics and decision rights** with precision.
- Integrate **AI-native capabilities** responsibly and effectively.
- Ensure **global reproducibility** for multi-country operations.
- Scale decision-making with a **future-ready operating model**.

(Frameworks coming soon.)
